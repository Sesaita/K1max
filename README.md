Now in testing, increased the Size of the Y rod to 10mm instead of 8mm(10mmx400mm H6), LMUW10 and reinforced the X Rail with a 10x10x405mm extrusion. \
The Extrusion is highly debatable, planing a future Version without it.

The Camera probably needs a different Mount as the bigger XY Joints now touch it.
